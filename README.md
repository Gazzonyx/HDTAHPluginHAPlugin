# HDTAHPluginHAPlugin

An unoffical HearthArena Plugin for the ArenaHelper Plugin (https://github.com/rembound/Arena-Helper) for HearthStone Deck Tracker (https://github.com/Epix37/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker). Very "Inception" I know.

This plugin is VERY unoffical and if you are using it you should consider donating to HearthArena (see http://www.heartharena.com/) and show them your support for their work.

This plugin will be removed from github if requested.

# Installation Instructions

1. Extract the contents of the zip into ArenaHelper\plugins. 
2. Right click on the .dll file and select properties, then unblock.
3. Restart Hearthstone Deck Tracker.

Note: the ArenaHelper plugin system is very much in a state of flux. The latest release (0.0.4) works for ArenaHelper 0.4.1, but this could break with future releases.
